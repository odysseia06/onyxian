# paper-pipeline

Read the resolved domain root from `.vault/config.yaml` under `modules.research.vars.root` (called `<root>` below).

## Naming — exact, no exceptions

Paper summaries and PDFs share one name: `CitationKey - Short Title` (e.g. `Komlo2024 - FROST.md` beside `Komlo2024 - FROST.pdf`). The citation key is FirstAuthorYear. Never organize papers into subfolders — they live flat in `<root>/Paper-Summaries` and `<root>/Paper-PDFs`; metadata and the Paper Library Base do the organizing.

## Types — exactly these seven

`attack`, `construction`, `engineering`, `foundations`, `framework`, `protocol`, `survey`. Each has a typed template (Templates folder, under `Research/`) whose middle sections ask the questions that matter for that kind of paper; the interactive `Paper Summary` template prompts for everything and renames the note itself (needs Templater). If a paper genuinely fits none, ask the user — do not invent a type.

## Statuses — exactly these four

`to-read` → `reading` → `summarized` → `revisiting` (when returning to a summarized paper). Set `date_summarized` when the summary is filled; the Base's views (To Read, Reading Now, Summarized, Revisiting, By Type, High Priority) are driven entirely by this frontmatter, so keeping it accurate IS maintaining the library.

## Frontmatter

Papers carry the pipeline's own rich schema (title, aliases, authors, year, venue, type, topics, tags incl. `paper`, status, priority, rating, citation_key, pdf, doi, url, date_added, date_summarized, compares_to, improves_on, related_work, summary_template, personal_take). Preserve it exactly — for paper notes this schema outranks the vault's generic core keys, and the `type` field means paper type, with `tags: paper` marking the note class. `personal_take` is a one-liner that surfaces in Base views; `compares_to` / `improves_on` / `related_work` hold citation-key wikilinks.

## Beyond summaries

- Topic notes (`<root>/Topic-Notes`) braid threads across papers — one note per research thread, linking the relevant summaries.
- Reading lists (`<root>/Reading-Lists`) are ordered wikilink runs assembled for a purpose (a deep dive, a course, a review); annotate why each paper is on the list.
- Open questions (`<root>/Open-Questions`) get one note each, linking the papers that raise or partially answer them.
- Literature maps (`<root>/Literature-Maps`) are canvases or notes mapping an area; build them from summaries, not from scratch.
