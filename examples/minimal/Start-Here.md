# Start here

Onyx manages this vault. The engine regenerates this note when your module set changes; the moment you edit it, it is yours, and future versions will arrive beside it as `Start-Here.md.new` instead of overwriting you.

## Enabled modules

- **core** 0.1.0 — The conventions every other module builds on: the Templates root, the vault home note, and the frontmatter and naming rules that humans and agents share.

## First actions

- **core**: Open Home.md in Obsidian; it explains what was installed and how the safety contract works. The note is seeded: it is yours now, replace it freely.

## Working the vault

- `.vault/config.yaml` declares your intent. Edit it freely, then run `onyx plan` to preview the effect and `onyx apply` to reconcile.
- `onyx add <module>` enables more modules, `onyx modules` lists what exists, and `onyx doctor` checks vault health read-only.
- Everything here works without any agent: templates are plain copies, views are plain files, and deleting `.claude/` costs convenience, never function.
